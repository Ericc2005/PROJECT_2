            <p>If you’re the one getting cyberbullied, there are many ways for you to solve this problem. If the bully is from your school then contact a trusted adult from school and let them know what’s happening and who’s doing it. If the bully is not from your school, still contact a trusted adult for help before the hate messages get consistent. Don’t give the bully attention by replying back with neither hate nor calm messages. The best and easiest way to avoid cyberbullying is to just not respond to the bully, ignore all hate messages, and block the bully online.
