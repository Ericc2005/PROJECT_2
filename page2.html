            <p>Online safety has been a problem since the day social media existed. Social media is a way of posting things such as about your life and texting or calling your friends. Most social media that is used today are tiktok, snapchat, reddit, instagram, twitter, and youtube. These are the most popular social media and the most toxic people that use it. These problems start off with many different ways but most end the same.

            <p>People send hate messages to others because they want the attention or they think it’s funny to troll and mess around with others. This can lead to “cyberbullying” which is essentially bullying people online. Cyberbullies are mostly teens that attack teens on the internet and can cause them to be depressed, insecure, or commit suicide. Most of these teens can't have a good school experience because they get cyberbullied. Without online safety, people experience the most hateful messages.
